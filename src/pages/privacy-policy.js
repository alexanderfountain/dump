            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <h5>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.</h5>
            <p>
                Your privacy is extremely important to us. Below is our Privacy Policy, which explains what personal information we collect and how we use that information.
            </p>
            <p>
                This document covers the use and treatment of the website located at {Paths.mainUrl} (the “Site”) and the mobile applications, products, portals, software, data feeds, and services (collectively with the Site, the “Service”) provided by Alliance Disposal LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Alliance" “We,” “Our", “Us” or similar references), including how Alliance treats information (including, personal information) that we collect and receive. The term “Personal Information”, as used in this Privacy Policy, refers to any information that can be used to identify a specific person, company or any anonymous information (e.g. IP address) that is linked to a specific person or company (including name, address, phone number or email address).  Personal Information does not include information that has been aggregated or made anonymous such that it can no longer be reasonably associated with a specific person or company or directly identify you. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate data about our users and customers with third parties for various purposes. This Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into Alliance&apos;s <Link to={Paths.tos}>Terms of Use</Link> (“Terms of Use”). Alliance may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect on the date set out in the posted Privacy Policy, unless otherwise specified.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies to persons and companies anywhere in the world who use our Service to request or receive pickup or other on-demand hauling services (“Users”). If you interact with the Services as both a User and a hauler, the respective privacy statements apply to your different interactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alliance may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal information that does not directly enable Alliance to identify you. The types of non-personal data Alliance may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to IP address, Media Access Control (“MAC”) address and unique device identifier or other persistent or non-persistent device identifier (“Device ID”); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; and (iv) other non-personal data as reasonably required by Alliance to enhance the Service. Application usage information may be tracked to determine which features are most popular, how they are being used, and how we can improve the applications and Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alliance may use and disclose to Company partners and contractors the collected non-personal information for purposes of analyzing usage of the Service, advertisement serving, managing and providing the Service and to further develop the Service and other Alliance services and products.
            </p>
            <p>
                You recognize and agree that the analytics companies utilized by Alliance may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to protecting your privacy. You may add, delete or modify your Personal Information at any time. Subject to your permission or as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy, exchange or otherwise share your Personal Information with third parties. By using the Service you agree to the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alliance does not guarantee or warrant the security of our servers nor can we guarantee that information you supply through the Service will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. When you enter sensitive information on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secured socket layer technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Information Collection and How it is Used</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Service (including through User Submissions (as defined in the Terms of Use)), whether via computer, mobile phone, tablet or other wireless device that you provide to us in any other way.  We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include: name, email, phone number, postal address, profile picture, payment method, items requested (for pickup services), pickup notes, and other information you choose to provide. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. You may modify or remove your Personal Information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and/or account information.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use our Service, we collect information about you in the following general categories:
            </p>
            <p>
                Location Information: When you use the Service for trash pickup and hauling, we collect precise location data about the pickup location. If you permit the mobile app to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system, we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
            </p>
            <p>
                Transaction Information: We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount to be charged (or weight of pickup), distance traveled, and other related transaction and hauling details.
            </p>
            <p>
                Usage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Service, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Call and SMS Data: Our Service facilitates communication between Users and haulers. In connection with facilitating this service, we may receive call data, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of the SMS message.
            </p>
            <p>
                Log Information: When you interact with the Service, we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Service. This information does not identify you personally. Generally, we use this information to improve this Site and Service and make it more compatible with the technology used by our visitors. However, we may link information sent by your browser to information that identifies you personally. For example, if you are a registered member, we may link your IP address to information that identifies you personally. In addition, if we suspect criminal activity, we may share our server logs with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similar to many other websites, we use “cookies” to enhance your experience on the Site. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive by websites. We use cookies as a convenience feature to save you time, to understand how the Site is used, and to improve the content and offerings on the Site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience on the Site or recall your specific information on subsequent visits. If your browser is set not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you may not be able to access certain features or services of the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have supplied us with your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, ask for your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Alliance and our products. If you would prefer not to receive marketing or promotional e-mails from us that may relate, for example, to new services or offerings, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the opt-out mechanism in an email or by specifying your email communication preferences in your account settings. Following your opt-out, please be aware that we, or our affiliates, may continue to contact you via email for administrative or informational purposes, including, but not limited to, follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, any services, features or functions you have affirmatively enrolled in or registered to use, any promotions or sweepstakes you have participated in or have entered, or other transactions you have undertaken on the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                From time to time, Alliance may ask its registered users to participate in surveys. These surveys are purely optional and help us improve the Service and provide aggregate information which we think may interest our registered users and visitors. We may use the information that you voluntarily provide as part of your survey response in the manner outlined in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if you choose to participate in an Alliance survey, any information you provide to us, including personal information, will be linked with your account in our system and to any personal information contained therein. We may also use the information you provide in the aggregate to help us generate statistics regarding use of the Service. If you would not like your information to be used in this way, please do not participate in Alliance surveys or, if participating, please provide us only with information you consent to our use of in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
