                    10 yard dumpster pricing is affected by three categories: location, material and weight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pricing changes from county to county as each sets their own disposal rates. This is the biggest factor as it is the main driver of the price.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The material you need to dispose of also affects the price. Different materials can have different disposal rates as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lastly the weight of the material you put into the dumpster will determine the final price you'll pay.

                        A typical 10 yard dumpster is 10 feet long by 8 feet wide by 3.5 feet tall. Dimensions may vary slightly, but all 10 yard dumpster rentals have the same capacity and volume of 10 cubic yards.

                <p>
                    A 10 yard dumpster can hold 10 cubic yards of material. That is the equivalent of about 4 pickup truck beds. On average most people get a 2 ton weight limit (4,000 lbs). This may change based on the type of material you have. With our online ordering you can select your own ton limit to fit your project's needs.

                    The process starts with finding the right weight limit for the material you have. Weight limits are based off of US tons, where 1 ton is equal to 2,000 pounds. A weight limit is a pre purchased amount of material that you can put into the dumpster at a discounted disposal rate.

                    Delivery and loading
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Once you order your dumpster the next step is delivery. We always check Google Maps to make sure that we send the right size truck so that deliveries always go smoothly. If youâ€™re not on Google Maps donâ€™t worry weâ€™ll contact you ensure you donâ€™t experience any delivery delays or hiccups.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here are a few tips to make sure you have a great experience:
                </p>

                <ul style={{textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: 20}}>
                    <li>
                        <b>Drop location:</b> Weâ€™ll need about 60 feet of space to deliver the container. Please move all obstructions that would prevent the truck to having access to your desired drop location. Such as moving cars out or to the side of your driveway.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Look up:</b>  Most trucks need about 23 feet of vertical clearance to raise the dumpster and place it. However we do have more compact trucks that do not need as much clearance. If you think there will be an issue please call us.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Enjoy your day:</b> No one needs to be home for the delivery. Due to changing traffic conditions and delivery schedules your dumpster may arrive at anytime throughout the day. You can signup for text message updates to know when to expect your dumpster.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Load appropriately:</b> Do not place in any prohibited materials. Also be mindful of the rim, you cannot load above the dumpsters rim as it will pose a hazard to other drivers on the road.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style={{margin: '37px 0 0'}}>
                    Pick up and disposal
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Pick up is simple. Just let us know when you're done with your dumpster and will come get it out of the way for you. No one needs to be home for the pick up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will then bring your dumpster to the appropriate disposal facility for proper treatment. If you dumpster is within your weight limit youâ€™re all set! If the dumpster did go over the weight limit we will charge the appropriate and agreed upon overage disposal fee.
                </p>

                    Youâ€™ll receive your payment receipt by email.
