                    Three factors that affect 40 yard dumpster pricing: location, material and weight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Location. Each county can set their own disposal rates, the per ton cost to get rid of your material. Meaning pricing changes from county to county.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Material. Different materials get sent to different facilities. Each charging a disposal rate changing based on the specific type of material you are disposing of.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Weight. The actual weight of the material you put into the dumpster affects the weight limit you'll need and ultimately the price of your dumpster rental.

                    Let's estimate how much weight you'll be putting into the 40 yard dumpster. Weight limits are based off of US tons, where 1 ton is equal to 2,000 pounds. Having trouble figuring out how much your debris weighs? Give us a call <TelDisplay />. We'll happily help by going over your project with you to determine the best weight limit for your project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A weight limit is a pre purchased amount of material that you can put into the dumpster at a discounted disposal rate. Use our <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>online ordering</Link> to go step by step to find the best weight limit for you

                </h3>

                <p>
                    Now that you've ordered your dumpster, it's time for it to be delivered. We check Google Maps before your delivery we make sure that there won't be any unforeseen issues with placement. If we anticipate an issue we'll contact you to make sure the dumpster can be placed where you want it, or find a suitable alternative delivery placement.

                <p>
                    Below are a few tips to help ensure you have a great experience:
                </p>

                <ul style={{textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: 20}}>
                    <li>
                        <b>Horizontal space:</b> Delivery trucks need about 60 feet of space in front of the placement location. Please remove any items that may be in the path between the truck and the drop spot. Move any cars out or to the side of your driveway.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Vertical space:</b>  The truck also needs about 23 feet of vertical clearance so that it can lift the dumpster and place it properly. Don't have the space? Give us a call <TelDisplay /> and we'll figure out how to place the dumpster.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>No need to be home:</b> No one needs to be home for the delivery! Changing traffic conditions and erratic lines at disposal sites make it hard to predict exactly when your dumpster will be delivered. You can stay up to date with text message updates if you'd like.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Be careful what you throw in:</b> Prohibited and hazardous materials cannot go into the dumpster. Also do not fill the container above it's sides, because we may not be able to pick it up.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style={{margin: '37px 0 0'}}>
                    Pick up and disposal
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Pick up is easy. Just let us know when you're done filling your dumpster and we'll pick it up in a jiffy. No one needs to be home for the pick up either.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We bring your material the appropriate facility for disposal. If you are within your weight limit youâ€™re all set! If the dumpster is over the weight limit the prorated overage fee will automatically be applied.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Youâ€™ll receive your payment receipt by email.
