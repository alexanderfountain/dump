                <p>
                    The three main factors that affect 30 yard dumpster pricing are: location, material and weight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The biggest factor is location. Pricing changes from county to county since each set their own disposal rates, the per ton cost to get rid of your material.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Which brings us to our second factor, the material you are disposing of. Different materials go to different facilities, each charging a different disposal rate depending on what type of material it is.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lastly the actual weight of the material you put into the dumpster can change the price you pay. It will only change the price if you put in more weight than the weight limit you purchased.
                </p>

                        Typically 30 yard dumpsters are 20 feet long by 8 feet wide by 5 feet tall. While dimensions may vary slightly between container styles, all 30 yard dumpster rentals have the same capacity and volume of 30 cubic yards.

                    First off let's estimate how much weight you'll be putting into the 30 yard dumpster. Weight limits are based off of US tons, where 1 ton is equal to 2,000 pounds. A weight limit is a pre purchased amount of material that you can put into the dumpster at a discounted disposal rate. Our <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>online ordering</Link> will take you step by step to help you find the best weight limit for you

                <p>
                    Ok you've ordered your dumpster, now onto delivery. By checking Google Maps before your delivery we make sure we send the appropriate sized truck so that your delivery is a breeze. If we anticipate any issues with your delivery we'll contact you to make sure the dumpster can be placed where you want it, or find a suitable delivery placement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below are a few tips to help ensure you have a great experience:
                </p>

                <ul style={{textAlign: 'left', paddingLeft: 20}}>
                    <li>
                        <b>Dumpster placement:</b> The truck needs about 60 feet of space to place the container. Please move any cars out or to the side of your driveway, and remove all obstructions that would be in the path between the truck and your delivery spot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Watch for wires:</b>  The average truck needs about 23 feet of vertical clearance in order to raise the dumpster and place it in location. Don't have the space? Don't worry we compact trucks that do not need as much clearance. If you think that there will be an issue please call us.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>No need to wait around:</b> Great news, no one needs to be home for the delivery! With changing traffic conditions and unpredictable wait times at disposal sites it is hard to know exactly when your dumpster will arrive. If you'd like to stay up to date you can take advantage of our text message updates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>The kitchen sink:</b> The kitchen sink can go into the dumpster, but do not throw in any prohibited materials. Also do not load over the top of the dumpster, as we may not be able to pick it up.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 style={{margin: '37px 0 0'}}>
                    Pick up and disposal
                </h3>

                <p>
                    Pick up is even easier. Simply let us know when you're done with your dumpster and promptly pick it up. No one needs to be home for the pick up either.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We will dispose of your material at the appropriate facility, in order to maximize recycling efforts. If you are within your weight limit youâ€™re all set! If the dumpster goes over the weight limit the agreed upon overage disposal fee will automatically be charged.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Youâ€™ll receive your payment receipt by email.
