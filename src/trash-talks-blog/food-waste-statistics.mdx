# Food Waste Statistics

Did you know that over 80 billion pounds of food is thrown away each year in the United States alone? 80 billion pounds is equivalent to 1,000 Empire State Buildings. This 80 billion pounds equates to 219 pounds per person. There needs to be change. 22% of municipal solid waste is food, making it the largest component in United States landfills. There are many things Americans and restaurants can be doing to reduce food waste dramatically. Not only is this food waste a threat to the economy, but it is a huge threat to the environment.

## Reasons for Food Waste

### Spoilage

A large factor in food going to waste is spoilage. People are too scared to have an item if it is a day or two after the use by date, and resort to throwing the item out. A lot of people also confuse the “sell by”, “use by”, “best by”, or “best before” date. Customers tend to overestimate the amount of food they need, causing them to buy more and waste it.

### Left in the Fields

Farmers typically reject the food that they know will not sell in supermarkets. Examples of this are fruits and vegetables that taste fine, although they do not look typical. This is usually just a simple discoloring of the food or the shape of the fruit or vegetable is slightly disfigured. Farms leave these foods because customers won’t buy them. In the future, farmers should look into donating these fruits to homeless shelters. If the food is perfectly fine to eat, someone who is not able to afford food would be just fine eating it. There are some great companies out there trying to tackle this problem, such as <a href="https://www.imperfectfoods.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Imperfect Foods</a>, where they sell these "ugly" fruits and vegetables directly to consumers.

### Food is Thrown Out in the Supermarket

Food is thrown out in the supermarket when it is not sold by the sell by date, or starts to rot. This most commonly happens to fruits and vegetables that are at the bottom of the pile and not taken, so they go bad or overripe. This happens because supermarket's order more than they know they are going to sell, because they don’t want to run out of any items. Supermarkets also believe that customers would rather see <a href="https://www.ecoandbeyond.co/articles/causes-of-food-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">full shelves of produce</a>. The USDA estimates that supermarkets lose <a href="https://foodprint.org/issues/the-problem-of-food-waste/#easy-footnote-bottom-35-1309" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">$15 billion each year</a> in unsold fruit and vegetables alone.

### Food Waste in Restaurants and Institutions

Restaurants in the United States generate about <a href="https://foodprint.org/issues/the-problem-of-food-waste/#easy-footnote-bottom-35-1309" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">22 to 33 billion pounds of food waste</a> each year. Institutions which include hotels, schools, and hospitals generate an extra 7 to 11 billion pounds per year. This is often due to the fact of people throwing away their uneaten food because restaurant portions have become a lot larger in the past few years. Many restaurants and institutions are scared to donate leftover food because of legal restrictions, they do not want to get sued. Buffets are unable to donate their leftover food because of health restrictions. Although, they typically waste a lot of food because they do not let their food run out before closing. Although it may be hard for buffets, other restaurants and institutions need to begin to be looking into how they can be donating their leftover food.

### Household Food Waste

Households generate the most food waste of any other place. According to foodprint.org, <a href="https://foodprint.org/issues/the-problem-of-food-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">7 to 11 billion pounds per year</a>. Household food waste typically comes from spoilage or over preparing. When making food for oneself or their family they typically make more than allotted for. Sometimes they throw away the leftovers or take too long to eat them and end up throwing them away.

## Tips for Restaurants to Reduce Food Waste

There are many different jobs and tips restaurants can begin to implement if they want to
start making changes to their restaurant. The following tips will help you <a href="https://possector.com/management/restaurant-food-waste-reduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">learn where you should begin to reduce food waste</a>:

- Restaurants should be creating a waste management team. It is important they have a group of people who focus on this topic. Not only will reducing waste help make your business help the world, but it will be saving your business a lot of money in the long run. This team will help track and analyze all the food that is being wasted in the restaurant. They will see what is being ordered and what is not. This is because if there aren't many people ordering a particular item on the menu, the food will eventually go to waste. If there are many items that are noticeably not being ordered, take them off the menu or replace it with something new. This will minimize the amount of leftover food, which overall has a great effect on the environment.

- Restaurants should also create a team that is responsible for managing the garbage. It would be smart if this team was also responsible for cleaning the dishes because they are the ones who are able to see what food is typically left over. The team should also include someone who deals with ordering and managing the food so they can keep track of what is not being ordered. When sorting the garbage, it should be separated in two different piles. One should consist of the food that is unused and has gone bad and the other should be with the food that was served and was uneaten so is being thrown out. It is good to measure the two separately so you could see where the greater amount of waste is coming from. It is important to know all these statistics because it helps the restaurant view where they can be improving. It is very important employees understand the importance of reducing waste therefore they will look out more which will help the restaurant determine how to cut it down.

- All employees need to be taught where different waste needs to be disposed. There should be different waste outlets in the restaurant including recycling, compost, and landfill. Staff members need to be aware of which can all of the food/items being served belong.
