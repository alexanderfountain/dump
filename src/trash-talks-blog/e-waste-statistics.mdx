# E-waste Statistics

## Electronic Waste Statistics Overview

E-waste or electronic waste is the result of discarded Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE). EEE products include circuit or electronic components and are charged by power cords or battery. Examples of electronic products include everything from mobile phones and laptops to kitchen appliances and smart security systems. 

While electrical and electronic equipment is increasingly essential for modern society to function and are strongly linked with higher living standards, its manufacturing requires the use of natural resources like copper, aluminum, and iron. The improper disposal of electronics results in economic and environmental damage when valuable or hazardous materials enter the waste stream. The following statistics highlight the extent of e-waste generation and the impact of improper disposal of electronic waste in North America and globally.

## Updated E Waste Stats

We sourced the most relevant and updated e waste statistics for you so that you can get a better understanding of electronic waste all in one place.

## Facts About E-Waste

- The rise in e-waste production is due to three factors: higher consumption rates of electronics or electronic equipment, shorter life-cycles of electronic products, and few repair options for broken or outdated electronics. 
- Three factors increase a society’s consumption of electronic products: higher levels of disposable income, urbanization, and industrialization.
- Recycling of e-waste is not keeping up with global growth in production of e-waste.
- E-waste is sometimes considered an “urban mine,” meaning that it contains precious, critical, and noncritical materials that can be reused as secondary materials. Precious materials discarded in e-waste include iron, copper, and gold components. 
- A small number of studies suggest the following health effects on children as a result of informal, unregulated e-waste recycling: increased or decreased growth, negative effects on immune system and lung function, adverse birth outcomes and altered neurological development.

Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind when recycling electronics or electrical equipment:

- If you can, try to reset the electrical equipment to its standard factory settings in order to protect your privacy. This applies to personal computers, cell phones, or other small devices, but it is just as important to reset smart TVs and printers to avoid potential privacy breaches.
- If your electronic or electrical equipment has a cord, wrap the cord around the device or keep it in a secured loop. This will make the item easier to carry to the recycling center and will also prevent a tripping hazard. 
- If the item is on the larger side, you might want to consider investing in a dolly or other sort of waste container. Be careful when transporting the unwanted electronics to avoid damage. Damaged electronics could potentially expose you to hazardous material components like lead or mercury. 
- For electronics that use a lithium ion battery, remove the battery if possible. These batteries should be transported and recycled with other batteries.
- If you are needing to properly dispose of large amounts of electronic appliances or devices, you may find it helpful to <Link to={Paths.rollOffDetails}>rent a dumpster</Link> or schedule a <Link to={Paths.junkRemovalDetails}>junk removal service</Link> to help you transport e-waste materials to proper collection sites.
