### Do I need a dumpster permit?

If you are looking to rent a dumpster in the township of Cherry Hill, there is no permit required if you are putting the dumpster on your driveway or property. This makes the process very simple for you, although if you are looking to put a dumpster in the street or on public property, call Alliance Disposal and we will help you with getting the proper approval.

### Ordering a dumpster rental

After following all these steps and carefully assessing your needs, you can order your dumpster. To do so you can go to our <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>online ordering page</Link> <Link to={Paths.quoteRollOff}>sending us an email</Link> or call us <TelDisplay />, whichever is best for you. The price we give you is determined on three main factors; the size of the dumpster, the type of debris you will be disposing of, and the weight requirements. There are no tricks or hidden fees, and we are always looking to give our customers affordable dumpster rentals.

The size and weight limit of the dumpsters are directly related. Each dumpster comes with a weight limit and a discounted disposal rate bundled in. You are however allowed to dispose of as much waste as you want. If your debris goes over the weight limit, it is not a problem, you simply pay a prorated rate for the excess to cover the additional disposal costs. We will be sure to verify your weight limit and this fee before you order your dumpster, so there are no surprises. We also provide you with a copy of the dump ticket from the state certified scale for full transparency. We are never looking to add in any surprises charges. Below, we have added some tips on how to prevent going over the weight limit for your dumpsters.
