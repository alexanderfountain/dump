## Dumpster Rental Types

### Household Dumpster Rentals

Our roll off dumpsters are made for the projects such as house clean outs, house remodels, yard clean outs, and more. Our roll off dumpster rentals come with a fourteen day rental period, although we offer extensions available at a daily flat rate fee. Ordering works by first selecting the best sized dumpster for the job. If you are unsure of what size would be best for you, contact us and we would love to help out. Next, make sure you know about the weight limitations for the dumpster you are receiving and make sure that it fits your needs. If you are working with heavier material, you may want to look into getting a concrete dumpster. After you decide which dumpster fits your needs best, we will drop it off whenever you need it for two weeks. After, we will come pick it up and dispose of it. We will let you know the final weight of your dumpster and if you stayed within the requirements. If you go over the weight limit, there will be an extra fee. But this fee will be known to you before you rent your dumpster. For every dumpster rental, we will plant a tree. Learn more about our <Link to={Paths.rollOffDetails}>roll off dumpsters</Link>.
