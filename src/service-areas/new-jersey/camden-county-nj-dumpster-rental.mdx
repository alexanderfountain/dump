## Camden County: Successfully Sustainable

We want to take a moment to congratulate the residents and government of Camden County on their efforts to promote sustainability within the community. At Alliance, we offset our carbon footprint by planting trees for every rental we service, and take measures to recycle as much as physically possible. We stand by this mission and enjoy celebrating towns and counties who are doing the same! If you didn’t already know, Camden County is the first and only county in the state of New Jersey to have an Office and Director of Sustainability. This office, and all of the employees within it, manage a significant number of greenhouses within Gloucester Township. They focus on growing annual and perennial plants for the local Camden County parks which has resulted in savings around $10,000 annually. Most recently, in October of 2016, the office launched a Hydroponic Greenhouse Program. This program has allowed them to grow a number of different fruits and vegetables which are donated to the County senior program and sold to local partnering restaurants.

From all of us here at Alliance, we thank you for taking initiative to promote sustainability in your community!

## The Alliance Disposal Difference

Customer service, sustainability, and transparency are at the core of everything we do at Alliance Disposal. We believe the way waste management is currently being handled is obsolete and over- complicated. Waste flows and volumes have changed, and we believe it is time our industry evolved with it. The brutal truth is that 99% of waste management companies have arbitrary pricing, lack proper customer service teams, take advantage of their customers, and do nothing to offset the large carbon footprint this industry leaves behind. We are the 1% doing everything we can to fix these age-old problems. We have a dedicated customer service team to support our customers, transparent pricing on our website so that you know exactly what you are paying for, and even plant a tree for every single dumpster rental. The choice seems obvious to us! <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>Order online now</Link>!
