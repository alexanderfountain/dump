### When Curbside Collection Won’t Cut It, Order a Roll-off Dumpster Rental 

For smaller projects, we encourage you to take advantage of local Egg Harbor Township curbside trash pickups, recycling collections, and local convenience center. Up to 300 lbs of regular household trash can be left curbside in the receptacle provided to you by the town on the day of your normal trash collection. There is a maximum weekly limit of one 96 gallon waste container per residence. Only household trash in the proper container will be collected. Loose or bagged waste near the container will not be collected. 

Please remember to keep recyclable materials separate from other household waste. Atlantic County utilizes single-stream recycling, so the following materials can be disposed of in the same container:
- Plastics (#1 and #2) 
- Soda or juice bottles
- Glass Items, bottles, or containers
- Paper including envelopes (business and manila)
- Cereal Boxes 
- Cartons (juice, milk, etc.) 
- Junk Mail, magazines and newspapers 
- Telephone Books 
- Cardboard (corrugated must be flattened and tied with twine)
- Metals including Aluminum, Steel, and Tin cans

You can place recyclable materials curbside in a Atlantic County Utilities Authority (ACUA) issued bucket or in a cardboard box marked with ACUA sticker. Recycling buckets are provided and collected by the <a href="http://www.acua.com/disposal-recycling/containers-stickers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Atlantic County Utilities Authority (ACUA)</a> or by calling 609-272-6950. 

Bulky trash including wood, brush, lumber, bedding, upholstered furniture, mattresses, and so on will be collected curbside at 6:00 AM on <a href="https://www.ehtgov.org/departments/public_works/sanitation.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">your scheduled collection week</a>. The monthly bulk trash curbside pickup is not for excess regular sanitary waste or construction and demolition debris. If the resident has more than a pickup truckload of bulky waste items, it will not be collected curbside and the resident is responsible for proper disposal. 

If you exceed the curbside collection limitations, you can either personally dispose of waste materials at the <a href="https://www.ehtgov.org/departments/public_works/convenience_center.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">convenience center</a> or rent a dumpster service through a company like Alliance Disposal. Alliance disposal will deliver the dumpster to your property and will pick it back up when it is full or after the complimentary 14 day rental period is up. <Link to={Paths.rollOffDetails}>Roll-off dumpster rentals</Link> will make your cleanup project easy. All you need to do is throw your items in the dumpster and Alliance Disposal will take care of the rest. If you would like to rent a dumpster now, you can <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>order online</Link>, by phone at <TelDisplay />, or via <Link to={Paths.quoteRollOff}>email</Link>.

### Dumpster Weight Limits and Limitations

When renting a dumpster, it is important to consider the amount and type of waste material that you will be throwing away in the dumpster. Each dumpster size and type comes with a pre-purchased weight limit. This weight limit is the amount of waste weight you can throw in the dumpster at a discounted rate. If you happen to go over the dumpster weight limit, no need to stress, you will simply pay the standard “overage” fee on the extra weight. At Alliance Disposal, we believe in total pricing transparency, so we will provide you with the official dump ticket and final dumpster weight so that you know exactly what you are paying for. 

It is especially important to take into account dumpster weight limits when your project cleanup includes removing heavy materials like concrete, brick, roofing materials, and other bulky items. If you expect to throw out debris like concrete, roofing shingles, or asphalt, renting a <Link to={Paths.constructionDumpsterRentals}>separate dumpster for construction waste</Link> is the most cost-effective and efficient way to go. 

Keep in mind that <a href="http://www.acua.com/uploadedFiles/Site/Disposal_And_Recycling/Recycling%20Flyer%202019.pdf" target="_blank" rel= "noopener norefferer">recyclable materials</a> should always be kept separate from other forms of waste, and if necessary, you may need to rent a separate dumpster for these items as well. Recycling is mandatory in Atlantic County and Egg Harbor Township. For more information on <a href="http://www.acua.com/disposal-recycling/residential/recycling/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener norefferer">Recycling Guidelines</a> or <a href="http://www.acua.com/recycling-drop-off/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener norefferer">drop off locations and hours</a>, please refer to the Atlantic County Utilities Authority (ACUA).

### What You Can Safely Throw in a Dumpster

In order to protect yourself and the environment, it is important to learn what can safely be thrown in a dumpster rental. In general, it is acceptable to throw away anything in a dumpster rental that you would typically discard in the trash. For your convenience, here is a list of common waste materials that can be thrown away in a dumpster:

- Bulky items like old furniture and appliances 
- Renovation debris including roofing shingles and dry wall
- Typical household junk 
- Yard and Storm debris
- Concrete, brick, dirt and stone

If you are planning on disposing your waste items at your local <a href="http://www.acua.com/disposal-recycling/rates-procedures-operation/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener norefferer">Atlantic County Utilities Authority</a> landfill, either in person or through a hired company like Alliance Disposal, be sure that your dumpster contents are in compliance with the ACUA’s disposal procedures. In particular, <a href="http://www.acua.com/disposal-recycling/residential/recycling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">recyclable debris </a>, <a href="http://acua.com/content.aspx?id=332" target="_blank" rel= "noopener norefferer">construction and demolition debris </a>, and <a href="http://acua.com/content.aspx?id=364" target="_blank" rel= "noopener norefferer">bulky items</a> like furniture, mattresses, and appliances should not be mixed in with other waste materials when brought to the discharge area. In order to learn more about the proper disposal of common materials or waste items in Atlantic County, you can utilize the <a href="http://www.acua.com/wastewizard/" target="_blank" rel= "noopener norefferer">Waste Wizard</a> lookup tool.

For a more in depth guide on what materials are okay and not okay to throw in a dumpster rental, you can read our handy guide <Link to={Paths.guideWhatCanGoIntoDumpster}>What Can You Throw in a Dumpster</Link>. 

### Rules and Regulations for Dumpster Rentals in Egg Harbor

You do not need a dumpster rental permit in Egg Harbor, as long as you are keeping the waste container on your private property such as in your yard or on your driveway. Alliance Disposal is always considerate when it comes to dumpster placement in accordance with local codes. If you need to place the dumpster on public property, you will need a permit before your dumpster arrives. To obtain a permit, please contact your local <a href="https://www.ehtgov.org/departments/clerk/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Egg Harbor Township Clerk’s office</a>, or reach out to our <Link to={Paths.contact}>customer service</Link> for help.
