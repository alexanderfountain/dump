## The Dumpster Rental Process 

### Step 1: What is the Project

You have to first think about your project and its needs. Maybe you are remodeling a bathroom, maybe you are remodeling your whole house, maybe you need help cleaning up debris after a storm. We have dumpsters for all of your waste management needs, and different dumpsters for the needs of different projects.

Below we have a list of examples of projects that may require you to rent a dumpster. These are some of the more common ones, and they tend to be large projects that produce a large amount of waste.

- Home Cleanouts
- Home and Commercial Remodeling Projects
- Roof Replacement and Re-Roofing Projects
- Storm Debris Cleanup
- Landscaping Jobs
- Deck and Fence Construction

If you see that your project isn’t listed above or if you don’t know for sure if you need a dumpster, feel free to contact us over the phone at <TelDisplay />, or by <Link to={Paths.contact}>email</Link> and we will be sure to help you determine what your needs are.

### Step 2: Figure Out Your Project's Needs

Once you have figured out whether or not you need to rent a dumpster, the next step is to predict how much waste your project can potential produce. By doing this, you are able to figure out what size dumpster you would need to order. Our sizes range from 10 yards to 40 yards. Just to give you a rough estimate, the <Link to={Paths.tenYardDumpster}>10-yard dumpster rental</Link> is good for smaller projects like a bathroom remodel or single room renovations while the <Link to={Paths.fortyYardDumpster}>40-yard dumpster rental</Link> is good for whole house remodeling or construction on a commercial building. The guide below can help you figure out which size you should go with as well as show you the base packages and prices for each. If you are not sure what size you need, you can contact us, and we will be able to guide you. Once you have selected the right dumpster for you, you are ready to order.

### Step 3: Check for Dumpster Permits

Washington Township allows its residents to keep roll off dumpsters as long as it is kept on the resident’s property. If you need to keep your dumpster on the street, you will have to contact them by calling (856) 589-0523 in case you need a permit to be able to do so.

### Step 4: Ordering your Dumpster Rental

After figuring whether or not you need a rental dumpster, what size you need, and checking for your area’s regulations, you are ready to order your roll off rental dumpster. You can <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>order online</Link> or you can call us at <TelDisplay />. Keep in mind that the price includes the size of the dumpster, the waste you will be getting rid of, and the weight. In case you go over the weight limit for your specific dumpster, all you have to do is pay a prorated rate for the additional waste, and we will discuss this with you before charging. After placing your order for a rental dumpster and scheduling its delivery, all you have to do is make sure your driveway is free of anything that can get in the way of the truck’s ability to drop off the roll off dumpster. 

### Step 5: Pick Up

Once you are done with the rental roll off dumpster, let us know and we will take care of the rest. After we pick up the dumpster, we transport the waste to the closest facility, and we try to recycle as much of the waste as possible. We also weigh the collected waste at the facility and compare it to the weight purchased. If the facility weight is less than the purchased weight, you are good to go. If it’s higher, a fee will be added to your bill for going over the limit. Because of this, it is very important to decide carefully what sized dumpster rental is right for you. So, if you know your construction project will produce a large amount of concrete waste, you can order our construction dumpster, but a concrete dumpster may be better if the amount of waste produced will be large.
