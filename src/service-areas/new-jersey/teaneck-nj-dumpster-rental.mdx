## Types and Sizes of Dumpsters for Rent

No project cleanup is too big or too small for Alliance Disposal dumpster rentals. We understand that it can be difficult to know what dumpster rental size is right for your project. That’s why we made this helpful <Link to={Paths.rollOffSizingGuide}>dumpster rental sizing guide</Link> that converts dumpster rental capacities into pickup truckloads for common cleanup projects. 

Some common projects that typically require a dumpster rental are commercial and residential <Link to={Paths.rollOffDetails}>property clean outs</Link>, <Link to={Paths.yardDumpsters}>yard debris removal</Link>, and <Link to={Paths.cAndDDumpsters}>construction or remodeling projects</Link>. Alliance Disposal has a rent-a-dumpster that will fit your project needs based on the type, amount, and weight of your waste materials.

Dumpsters come in 10, 20, 30, and 40 yard capacities. You may be asking the question: just how much debris can I fit in a roll off dumpster rental? To answer that question, we can break down each dumpster size by capacity and appropriateness for common projects.

- <Link to={Paths.tenYardDumpster}>10 cubic yard dumpsters</Link> are equivalent to 4 pickup truck beds of waste material. This size roll-off dumpster will work for attic or basement cleanouts, single-room renovations, 250 sq feet of deck removal and 1500 sq feet of old roofing shingles.
- <Link to={Paths.twentyYardDumpster}>20 cubic yard roll-off dumpsters</Link> will fit 8 pickup truck beds of debris. A 20 yard dumpster is perfect for larger home projects including multiple room renovations, complete roof replacements, or disposal of yard waste like small trees. This dumpster also has the capacity to cover small commercial construction projects. 
- <Link to={Paths.thirtyYardDumpster}>30 cubic yard rent-a-dumpsters</Link> will hold 12 pickup truck beds of waste materials. This dumpster is large enough to handle almost all construction or demolition projects and whole-house cleanouts of bulky furniture or other large items. With a 30 cubic yard dumpster, you can dispose of storm debris including large trees or be prepared for new home constructions or large home or business renovation projects.
- <Link to={Paths.fortyYardDumpster}>The 40 cubic yard dumpster rental</Link> is meant for large and ongoing construction sites or home projects. With the largest capacity available, this dumpster will support waste and debris from commercial building or landscaping projects and home construction and demolition.

## Dumpster Rental Info for Teaneck New Jersey Residents

The dumpster rental process can be different depending on where you live. In the Township of Teaneck, New Jersey, renting a dumpster can be easy with a service like Alliance Disposal at your side to guide you through the process. Before you decide to rent a dumpster, we want you to give you some helpful tips that will save you time and money.

### Teaneck NJ Dumpster Rental Permits

The Township of Teaneck requires residents to obtain a Temporary Storage & Refuse Containers permit from the building department before renting a dumpster to be held on private property. The dumpster is supposed to be placed on the driveway. In order to get the dumpster rental permit form in Teaneck, please contact your local Building Department via email building@teanecknj.gov or by phone (201) 837-1600 Ext 1106, FAX (201) 837-4802. 

You will need to fill in the permit request form with the following information:
- Location or work site information
- Container information and type, including purpose, placement date, and phone number of carting or container company
- Property owner information, name, and home address
- Applicant information, name, and home address

Once you complete the form, you must submit your dumpster rental application with a $30.00 fee to the <a href="https://www.teanecknj.gov/building-department" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener norefferer">Teaneck Building Department</a>. If you have any questions on the permit application process, contact building@teanecknj.gov or ask Alliance Disposal to do it for you. We can connect you to the right local departments so that you can complete your application without a hassle.

If you are planning on renting a dumpster that must be placed in the street, or somewhere off of your private property, you must contact the Teaneck Engineering Department at (201) 837-1600 Ext. 1728 for further instructions. When you place a dumpster rental in the street, along a public sidewalk, or in a parking lot, New Jersey law requires you to place reflective markers or tape around the exterior of the waste container. Violations of this code may result in up to $100 in fees. To learn more visit the <a href="https://www.state.nj.us/transportation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">New Jersey Department of Transportation</a>.  

If you would like some help on the waste container permit application process, reach out to our friendly customer service and we will help you straighten things out so that you are prepared for your roll-off dumpster rental to arrive. 

### How Much Does it Cost to Rent a Dumpster in Teaneck NJ

Dumpster rentals vary depending on a few factors. The first is your location or the town or city where you expect the dumpster to be delivered. The second is the type and amount of waste materials that you plan on disposing in the dumpster. 

Keep in mind that different types of materials tend to weigh more than others. These heavy materials can quickly increase your dumpster rental weight and may cause you to exceed the pre purchase weight limit associated with your dumpster size and type. In order to save money and ensure that your dumpster is not charged the standard, prorated overage fee on the excess weight, we recommend renting a separate dumpster for materials like <Link to={Paths.roofingDumpsters}>roofing shingles</Link> and <Link to={Paths.concreteDumpsters}>concrete or other heavy debris</Link>. This way, you will get a better deal with special pricing and flexible flat rate options. 

If you do happen to go over the pre-purchase weight limit for your dumpster rental size and type, no worries. You will simply pay the standard overage fee on the excess weight. Alliance Disposal believes in total price transparency, so we will provide you with a copy of the dump ticket and scale reading so you know exactly what you are paying for.

### What Types of Materials You Can - and Can’t - Throw in a Dumpster

For the most part, you can throw anything in a dumpster rental that you would normally dispose of in a trash can.

- Antifreeze 
- Motor oil
