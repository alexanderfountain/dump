## The Dumpster Rental Process

### Step 1: Define Your Project

Before you rent a roll off dumpster, first think about your project. Are you remodeling a bathroom? Are you remodeling your whole house? Do you need to clean up debris after a storm? Some projects may need the use of a rental dumpster while some projects may need the use of our other services.

The list below provides different projects a roll off dumpster can be used for. These are some of the more common ones, and they tend to be large projects that produce a large amount of waste.

- Home Cleanouts
- Home and Commercial Remodeling Projects
- Roof Replacement and Re-Roofing Projects
- Storm Debris Cleanup
- Landscaping Jobs
- Deck and Fence Construction

If your project isn't listed above, don't worry. If you aren’t sure whether or not your specific project requires a roll off dumpster, visit our <Link to={Paths.services}>services</Link> page to learn more. If you need more guidance on figuring out if you need to rent a dumpster or not, you can contact us over the phone at <TelDisplay />, or by <Link to={Paths.contact}>email</Link> and we will be sure to help you determine what your needs are.

### Step 2: Figure Out Your Project's Needs

After figuring out if your project requires a dumpster rental, the next step is to figure out what size your rental roll off dumpster should be because each project produces a different amount of waste. Our sizes range from 10 yards to 40 yards. Just to give you a rough estimate, the 10-yard dumpster rental is good for smaller projects like a bathroom remodel or single room renovations while the 40-yard dumpster rental is good for whole house remodeling or construction on a commercial building. The guide below can help you figure out which size you should go with as well as show you the base packages and prices for each. If you are not sure what size you need, you can contact us, and we will be able to guide you. Once you have selected the right dumpster for you, you are ready to order.

### Step 3: Check for Permits

To keep a rental roll off dumpster in Flemington, a permit is not required as long as it is kept on your personal property like your driveway. However, to find out if you can keep your dumpster on public street, you would need to contact your town hall in case you need a permit for that.

### Step 4: Ordering your Dumpster Rental

After figuring whether or not you need a roll-off container, what size you need, and checking for your area’s regulations, you are ready to order your roll off dumpster rental. You can order online, by sending us an email, or you can call us at <TelDisplay />. Keep in mind that the price includes the size of the dumpster, the waste you will be getting rid of, and the weight. In case you go over the weight limit for your specific dumpster, all you have to do is pay a prorated rate for the additional waste, and we will discuss this with you before charging. After placing your order for a rental dumpster and scheduling its delivery, all you have to do is make sure your driveway is free of anything that can get in the way of the truck’s ability to drop off the roll off dumpster. 

### Step 5: Pick Up

Once you are done with the rental roll off dumpster, let us know and we will take care of the rest. After we pick up the dumpster, we transport the waste to the closest facility, and we try to recycle as much of the waste as possible. We also weigh the collected waste at the facility and compare it to the weight purchased. If the facility weight is less than the purchased weight, you are good to go. If it’s higher, a fee will be added to your bill for going over the limit. Because of this, it is very important to decide carefully what sized dumpster rental is right for you. So, if you know your construction project will produce a large amount of concrete waste, you can order our construction dumpster, but a concrete dumpster may be better if the amount of waste produced will be large.

## Recycling in Flemington, New Jersey

Alliance encourages everyone to recycle because of its benefits for the environment. Recycling is picked up every other Thursday, and residents of Flemington should have their recyclables on their curbs by 7:00 am. Even though there is a limit to how much trash you can dispose for pickup, there is no limit to how much you can recycle. Recyclables include glass, plastic items, aluminum and steel food cans, paper, cardboard, magazines, phone books, and junk mail that is not plastic coated.

To get rid of lawn waste such as grass clippings and tree branches, you must also place those on the curb for pickup by the Public Works Department. This waste is collected every few days. However, it is important to keep in mind that tree stumps, logs, and branches are not accepted for pick up. You can learn more about <a href='http://www.historicflemington.com/Departments/public-works' target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Flemington's Recycling Program</a> on their website.

Also, Alliance does offer on demand pickup if you are in need of disposing some branches or an item or two in case you are unable to have a Flemington organization reach you.


## Recycle Coach App

Some towns in New Jersey are participating in an app called <a href='https://recyclecoach.com/' target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Recycle Coach</a>. Recycle Coach provides trash and recycling information unique for your selected town. The app gives users pick up schedules for trash and recycling for their respective towns, and it allows users to set reminders as well to they don't forget to leave their waste on the curb. It also lets you know how to dispose different items, as in whether they belong in recycling or in the trash. Not only that, it also provides users local news for their town, advice on responsible recycling, and the option to connect Amazon Alexa. We definitely encourage the use of this app for everyone, not just residents of Flemington. The Recycle Coach app is a step towards a better environment, and it is also a helpful tool for everyone to keep track of their responsibilities when it comes to their trash and recycle.


## Construction & Demolition Dumpster Rentals

If you are working on a home project that requires you to knock down walls or put them up, you will need an appropriate dumpster for the waste produced. Alliance is the perfect choice for a <Link to={Paths.cAndDDumpsters}>construction and demolition dumpster rental</Link>. In the construction dumpster, can dispose material from drywall, carpeting and flooring to windows, lumber, and bricks. Concrete and asphalt may be disposed in our construction dumpster as well, but if you have a large quantity of said materials, you may want to look into our concrete dumpsters mentioned below. The sizes of our construction dumpsters range from 10 yards to 40 yards. The 10-yard dumpster is perfect for small renovations like a bathroom remodel. The 40-yard dumpster is a great option for remodeling an entire house or building a commercial building.

### Concrete Dumpster Rentals

As mentioned above, concrete materials can be disposed in our construction dumpsters, but it is important to keep in mind the weight limits and overage fees of our dumpsters. Since concrete, brick, asphalt and other aggregates are so heavy we offer specialty dumpsters. With a <Link to={Paths.concreteDumpsters}>heavy material dumpster rental</Link> you'll either benefit from flat rate, no ton limit, pricing or high ton limits with severely discounted disposal rates depending on your material. We are able to offer this pricing because we bring aggregates to specialty disposal facilities that will recycle the material so that it may be used again. In order to bring material to these specialty facilities it must be separated from other materials and free of any trash contaminants.
