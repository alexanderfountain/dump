### You Will Need to Consider Local Waste Disposal Rules and Regulations

You do not need a permit to rent a dumpster in Toms River Township. However if you are placing the dumpster into the street you will need to get approval from the town. This makes renting a dumpster very easy, but for small projects, you can also take advantage of Toms River Public Works <a href='https://tomsrivertownship.com/191/Public-Works' target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">waste management programs and services</a>.

For small projects, the <a href='https://tomsrivertownship.com/200/Toms-River-Township-Recycling-Convenienc' target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Toms River Recycling Convenience Center</a> permits residents to bring no more than two 35 gallon containers of construction or demolition debris to the Recycling Convenience Center twice a month. All debris must be containerized in order to be accepted. Proof of residency is required on site with a driver’s license, utility bill, or tax bill. This service is not available for contractors, demolition crews, or commercial vehicles. Toms River Public Works gives more information and a complete list of materials accepted at the Recycling Convenience Center.

Toms River Township will not provide curbside pick up of demolition or construction debris. If you have more waste than the Recycling Convenience Center permits, it is required that the materials be brought to an approved landfill such as the Ocean County landfill off of State Highway 70 in Manchester Township. This must be done by the resident or through a hired licensed trash hauling company.

Alliance Disposal can take care of your bulk trash removal needs at this point through a dumpster rental or junk removal service. If you would like to go ahead and order a dumpster rental now, you can place an <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>order online</Link>, by <TelDisplay />, or via <Link to={Paths.quoteRollOff}>email</Link>. We would be happy to provide you with a convenient and quality bulk trash removal service so that you can focus your time and energy on your home or business project.

### Learn What You Can Throw Away in a Dumpster

Alliance Disposal accepts the standard materials that can be thrown away in a dumpster. So what are acceptable dumpster waste items?

What you can throw away in a dumpster:
- Household junk or anything you would normally throw away in the trash.
- Old furniture including couches, dressers, and tables. 
- Unwanted appliances like ovens, dryers, washing machines. Be sure to remove any <a href='https://tomsrivertownship.com/198/Household-Hazardous-Waste-Disposal-Progr' target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">hazardous materials</a> before disposing old appliances. If the appliance is in relatively good condition, you can also choose to reduce landfill waste by using an app like <a href='https://www.letgo.com' target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">letgo</a>.
- Renovation debris from your home renovation project such as drywall, siding, studs and any other non hazardous materials. Renovation waste tends to be heavier, so it is important to take waste material weight into consideration when planning your dumpster rental. To learn more about dumpster weights and overage fees, view our <Link to={Paths.rollOffDetails}>simple pricing guide</Link>. If you have any additional questions, please <Link to={Paths.contact}>contact us</Link> and we would be happy to help!
- Yard Waste such as tree branches, logs, bush and other wood debris or storm debris. Toms River Township runs a scrub and tree trimmings curbside collection during select weeks in the Spring and Fall seasons, or throughout the year through the Toms River Recycling Convenience Center. Visit <a href='https://tomsrivertownship.com/208/Shrub-Tree-Trimmings-Collection' target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Scrub/Tree trimmings collection</a> for more details such as collection dates and other important information. 
- Construction waste items such as roofing shingles, asphalt, concrete, rocks or dirt tend to be heavier than typical waste materials. You may consider renting a dumpster dedicated to these <Link to={Paths.roofingDumpsters}>roofing debris</Link> or <Link to={Paths.concreteDumpsters}>concrete waste</Link>. If you have any questions about waste material weights, we would be happy to help, just give us a call <TelDisplay />.

For small projects, you can request an extra collection pickup of nonmetal materials like mattresses, carpet, and upholstered furniture by contacting the Toms River Public Works department at 732-255-1000, ext. 8604. Carpets must be cut into four-foot strips and bounded in some manner while weighing no more than 50 pounds each. Furniture can remain intact. Place nonmetal items on the curb by 6:30 AM on the day following your normal weekly trash collection. If you live in an area without Robo cans, you can simply place the items on the curb as you would for your regular weekly collection. Visit the Toms River <a href='https://tomsrivertownship.com/207/Extra-Sanitation-Collection-Requests' target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Extra Sanitation Collection Requests</a> page for more details.

For disposal of metal items, you can contact the Toms River Public Works department at 732-255-1000, ext. 8170 to request an extra collection of a limited amount of metal waste. Once you are on the metal pickup list, place your items on the curb the Monday following your request at 6:30 AM. Metal waste items will be picked up that week sometime between Monday and Friday. Be sure to remove all hazardous waste materials before setting out your metal items for curbside pickup. If you would rather set your own schedule for removal or have more than the allotted amount of metal, <Link to={Paths.contact}>contact Alliance Disposal</Link> and we'll be happy to help you.
