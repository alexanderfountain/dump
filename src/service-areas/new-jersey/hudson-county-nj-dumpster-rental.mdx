### What can be thrown in a dumpster in Hudson County NJ?

As long as debris does not exceed the height of the dumpster wall, virtually any non-hazardous materials may be thrown away. This includes most household waste, bulky furniture, construction debris, yard waste, and appliances. 

### What cannot be thrown in a dumpster?

Certain hazardous waste cannot be disposed of in a dumpster anywhere in the United States. This includes asbestos, wet paint, electronics, tires, batteries, fuel, oil, propane tanks, hot water tanks, and other hazardous waste. If you have more questions regarding these regulations, our guide to <Link to={Paths.guideWhatCanGoIntoDumpster}>What You Can Throw in a Dumpster</Link> provides a much more comprehensive breakdown.

### How do I dispose of hazardous waste and restricted items in Hudson County NJ?

The <a href='https://www.nj.gov/dep/' target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection</a> has helped organize a convenient and robust program to help residents dispose of hazardous waste.

## Getting Creative About Recycling!

Here at Alliance Disposal, we love celebrating counties who develop creative and innovative ways to promote recycling. For the past 15 years, Hudson County has hosted an annual recycling contest for schools as a way to celebrate American Recycles Day on November 15. So far, students in Hudson County have collected over 16 tons of crayons! These crayons are recycled into new crazy-colored crayons and redistributed back to local schools. This is a fun and creative way to teach students about the importance of conservation at a young age. As a company dedicated to improving environmental sustainability ourselves, we applaud these efforts!

Other pro-recycling initiatives implemented by Hudson County Include:
- Urging residents to donate used cell phones, toner cartridges, inkjet cartridges and computer software, and using collection efforts to support the Susan G. Coleman Breast Cancer Foundation.
- Participating in the New Jersey Clean Communities Program which incorporates litter cleanup, enforcement, and education. The Hudson County Improvement Authority works with nonprofit organizations to conduct Cleanup projects around the county.

## Other Dumpster Rentals and Waste Services in Hudson County NJ

### Construction Dumpster Rentals

When working on a project site, the most important thing is safety. Constantly stepping over drywall and other debris not only slows down the process, but can be extremely dangerous as well. Renting a roll-off construction dumpster is essential to any large construction project. Clearing up debris speeds up your project and clears up space to make your client happy. Let us handle the busy work for you so you can focus on what matters most, getting the job done properly and making the client happy. To learn more, visit our <Link to={Paths.constructionDumpsterRentals}>construction dumpster</Link> page.

### Concrete Dumpster Rentals

Sometimes, a typical construction dumpster isn’t enough. Construction roll-off containers come with appropriate weight limits for general construction waste. However, if you’re working with a lot of concrete, the weight limit can easily be exceeded, shooting up the cost. That’s why Alliance Disposal provides a unique alternative rental option for disposing of heavy materials such as concrete, asphalt, block, and stone. Additionally, if these materials are kept separate and free from contaminants, they can be recycled, allowing you to help the environment while saving money! Whether you’re removing a driveway or tearing down a wall, or completely remodeling a home, a concrete dumpster is essential. Learn more on our <Link to={Paths.concreteDumpsters}>concrete dumpster</Link> page.
