The materials that are permitted recyclables include mixed paper, phone books, corrugated cardboard, hardcover books, glass jars and bottles, pet food cans, milk jugs and plastic bottles, aluminum and metal, beverage cartons, detergent and shampoo containers, and plastics with the #1 or #2 symbols.

### How can I dispose of electronics hazardous waste in Mercer County NJ?

Mercer County offers recycling events two to three times a year to aid residents in disposing of
documents, hazardous waste, and electronics. The events are split into two categories; document shredding, hazardous waste and electronics recycling.

Document shredding events are held in April and October and usually run from 9am-12pm at Lot 4 / South Broad Street (across from Mercer County Administration building). For this event, chemicals and other hazardous materials are restricted, and residents may only bring a maximum of eight boxes and/or bags of paper to shred.

Hazardous waste and electronics recycling events are held in March, June, and September and usually run from 8am-2pm at Dempster Fire School, 350 Lawrence Station Rd. The acceptable hazardous waste materials include aerosol cans, used motor oil, propane tanks, pesticides, herbicides, car batteries, paint thinner, oil-based paint, stains, varnishes, gasoline, anti-freeze, driveway sealer, insect repellant, mercury, and fluorescent and CFL bulbs. In terms of electronics, computers, printers, copiers, fax machines, stereos, televisions, and microwaves are all permitted for disposal.

These events are solely for Mercer County residents and proof of residency is required. Commercial businesses are not permitted to attend.
