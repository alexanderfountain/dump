Examples of hazardous waste include asbestos, wet paint, electronics, tires, batteries, fuel, oil, propane tanks, and hot water tanks. Our guide <Link to={Paths.guideWhatCanGoIntoDumpster}>What Can You Throw in a Dumpster</Link> outlines these regulations in more detail and answers more of the specific questions we have received regarding this.

### Do I need a permit to rent a dumpster in Monmouth County?

Permits are issued on the town level, so your specific permit needs will vary based on the city you live in. As a general rule, permits are typically not needed if you are placing a dumpster on private property, like your driveway. However, if you are planning on placing your dumpster on public property, like a county road, you may need to purchase a permit. To do so, you will need to apply for a permit through your city’s website. Of course, we always recommend double-checking permit requirements for your specific situation by calling your city. You can also find more information about permits in your particular city by visiting our <Link to={Paths.dumpsterPermits}>dumpster rental permits</Link> page.

Besides roll off containers for household items, Alliance Disposal offers many other dumpster rental services to the residents of Monmouth County. 

### Construction Dumpster Rental

When working on a project site, the most important thing is safety. Constantly stepping over drywall and other debris not only slows down the process, but can be extremely dangerous as well.
