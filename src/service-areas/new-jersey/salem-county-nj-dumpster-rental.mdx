### Dumpster Rental Weight Limits

When you are deciding which size dumpster is right for your project, you will need to consider dumpster rental weight limitations. Dumpster rentals come with a pre-purchase weight limit that is determined by dumpster size and type. At Alliance Disposal, we simply do not believe in hidden fees or surprise charges. That’s why this weight limit will always be clear to you before you order your dumpster rental. If you happen to exceed this weight limit, there is no need to worry. You will simply pay the standard, prorated overage fee on the excess weight. In the spirit of complete price transparency, we will always return a copy of the official dump ticket and scale reading so that you know exactly what you are paying for.

Certain materials are more likely to cause your dumpster to exceed its established weight limit. Heavier materials tend to result from construction sites, home renovation projects, and large-scale roof repair. To give you a better idea, here is a list of some materials that can push your dumpster over its weight limit:

- Tile, wood, and asphalt <Link to={Paths.roofingDumpsters}>roofing shingles</Link>
- Concrete, brick, stone, or other heavy rock-like materials
- Dirt, clay, and sand

Renting a separate dumpster if you are disposing <Link to={Paths.concreteDumpsters}>concrete or heavy debris</Link> tends to be the most cost effective and efficient option in the long run. Alliance Disposal offers special pricing and flat rates for heavy debris dumpsters, allowing you more flexibility at a better price than a standard overweight dumpster. If you have any questions about dumpster rental weight limits or would like us to guide you through your options, reach out to our <Link to={Paths.contact}>helpful customer service</Link> for more information on price sensible solutions for your waste disposal needs.

### Waste Disposal Options in Salem County

Before deciding to rent a dumpster, we encourage you to take advantage of your local waste management services. The <a href="https://scianj.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Salem County Improvement Authority</a> is your go-to when it comes to solid waste disposal in your area. The <a href="https://scianj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Keep-It-Covered-Brochure1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Salem County Convenience Center</a> in particular may be a good option if you are wanting to to get rid of trash that can’t be thrown out curbside. The convenience center <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/36+McKillip+Rd,+Woodstown,+NJ+08098/@39.5946229,-75.387656,13.71z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c718f9ecaf3467:0xac49bdceab93e42e!8m2!3d39.5881849!4d-75.3771298?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">disposal location</a> operates on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 8 am to 3 pm. Accepted waste includes:

- Bulky waste like construction and demolition materials
- Special waste, including tires and appliances like refrigerators or washing machines
- Electronic equipment such as old TVs, computers, printers, and hard drives
- Propane tanks
- Asphalt, concrete, and asphalt shingles - accepted only if clean and separated from other waste materials

Remember that it is the law to responsibly transport your waste material to the convenience center or any other waste facility. That means your vehicle must not be filled beyond its limits and all waste material should be covered with a tarp or cover while in transport. Failure to use a tarp and vehicle overload that causes littering, leaking, or spilling of waste materials will result in a $2000 fine. 

Materials that are not accepted at the Salem County Convenience Center include recyclables and household hazardous waste. Recycling services are provided through your municipality in conjunction with trash pickup services. Items that can be recycled in Salem County include:

- Glass of all colors
- Plastic bottles
- Paper, newspaper, and cardboard
- Aluminum and bi-metal/steel cans

Remember that recycling is the law in New Jersey! Read our <Link to={Paths.blog + 'simple-recycling/'}>Simple Recycling guide</Link> to learn how to properly recycle. Salem County also has plenty of <a href="https://scianj.com/recycling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">recycling resources</a>that can help you keep your community clean and sustainable. If you would like to learn more about recycling in your state, visit the <a href="https://www.nj.gov/dep/dshw/recycling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection Recycling Information page</a>.

Please do not bring household hazardous waste to the Salem County landfill or convenience center. Toxic waste can pollute your local environment. Examples of hazardous waste materials include but are not limited to:

- Oil-based paints
- Automotive products
- Cleaning fluids
- Solvents
- Garden care products

The Salem County Improvement Authority offers free hazardous waste disposal four times a year on the third Saturdays of April, June, August and October. For more information, contact the <a href="https://scianj.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Improvement Authority</a>. 

While local waste disposal centers and programs are very useful when taking on smaller cleanups, it may be more efficient and less time consuming to rent a dumpster for larger projects like home or business renovations, yard debris removal, or construction site cleanups. Alliance Disposal has the right dumpster container for your waste management needs. Let us do the hard work for you. When you rent a dumpster with Alliance Disposal, the dumpster is delivered right to your home or work site and is hauled away for you when the project is complete. We offer next business day delivery guaranteed and a complimentary 14 day rental period. If you would like to order a dumpster now, you can do so <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>online</Link>, by phone, or via <Link to={Paths.quoteRollOff}>email</Link>. We hope to make your dumpster rental experience as simple as possible, so if you have any questions on sizing, pricing, rental periods or anything else, please reach out to our <Link to={Paths.contact}>friendly customer service</Link> and we would be happy to work with you.

### Dumpster Rental Permits in Salem County

Some municipalities in Salem County may require that you have a dumpster rental permit. Typically, dumpster rental permits are not necessary when your dumpster will be placed on private property such as your driveway or yard. However, some towns might require a permit for all dumpster rentals. Before ordering your dumpster, you should check with your <a href="https://salemcountyclerk.org/municipalities-in-salem-county/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">town’s Clerk’s Office</a> for specifics on permit requirements. You can also utilize our convenient <Link to={Paths.dumpsterPermits}>Dumpster Rental Permit Lookup Tool</Link> or contact our customer service department, and we will look into the permit requirements in your town for you.

### What to Throw in a Dumpster

Once you obtain a dumpster rental permit (if necessary) and order your dumpster, it is important to know what you can and can’t throw in a dumpster. Common items that are generally okay to discard in a dumpster are:

- Old household junk and unwanted furniture
- Used appliances like dishwashers, ovens, and washing machines
- Renovation or construction debris 
- Yard waste or storm debris
- Roofing shingles
- Concrete, brick, stone, and asphalt

Be sure to double check with Alliance Disposal for more specific regulations. Some waste disposal sites require that materials like construction debris, roofing shingles, upholstered furniture or mattresses and other types of waste materials remain in a separate container. Breaking facility rules can result in fines or increased fees. On the other hand, you may be able to receive a discount for keeping certain materials like asphalt roof shingles in separate dumpsters. If you have specific questions, contact us and we can help you comply with your local waste disposal facility guidelines.
