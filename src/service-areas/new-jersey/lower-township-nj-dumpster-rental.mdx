### Weight Limits for Dumpster Rentals

When you have finished the process of figuring out which dumpster size you need, the next step is determining the best weight limit for your project. When you order online you can customize your weight limit by bundling in disposal costs at a discount. If you happen to go over the dumpster's weight limit, no worries. You simply pay for the additional weight on a prorated basis. We believe in full transparency and we never have any hidden fees. If you do go over the weight limit we will also provide you with a copy of your state certified scale test which will show the exact weight of your debris.

### Loading Your Dumpster

Great news! On the day of your delivery no one needs to be home. Our drivers will deliver the dumpster in the spot you designated either online or over the phone. On your delivery date, please make sure that there are no obstacles in the path of the truck to ensure successful placement.

Once you have received your dumpster you can begin filling it. While filling the dumpster be sure to not throw in any hazardous materials or load above the top of the container. Checkout our <Link to={Paths.guideWhatCanGoIntoDumpster}>guide on what you can and can't throw into a dumpster</Link> if you are unsure about what is allowed. All of our dumpster's come with a 14 day complimentary rental period. If you finish loading your dumpster early you can simply contact us and we'll come haul it away. If you need more than 14 days it's not a problem, it is a simple flat rate daily fee to extend your rental.

After your pickup is scheduled the driver will simply come and remove your roll off container and bring it to the proper disposal facility. Just like the delivery no one needs to be home for the pick up so long as there are no cars or other obstacles blocking access to the dumpster. At the disposal facility your debris will be weighed and we will be given a disposal ticket with the exact weight of your debris. If your weight is within the bundled weight limit you're all set! If it is over the limit you simply pay the agreed upon overage fee, prorated to your exact overage weight. We will also provide you with a copy of the disposal ticket for full transparency.
