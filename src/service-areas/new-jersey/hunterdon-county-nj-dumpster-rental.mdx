## Why Choose Alliance Disposal

Customer service, sustainability, and transparency are at the core of everything we do at Alliance Disposal. We believe the way waste management is currently being handled is obsolete and over-complicated. Waste flows and volumes have changed, and we believe it is time our industry evolved with it. The brutal truth is that 99% of waste management companies have arbitrary pricing, lack proper customer service teams, take advantage of their customers, and do nothing to offset the large carbon footprint this industry leaves behind. We are the 1% doing everything we can to fix these age-old problems. We have a dedicated customer service team to support our customers, transparent pricing on our website so that you know exactly what you are paying for, and even plant a tree for every single dumpster rental. The choice seems obvious to us! <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>Order online now</Link>!

3. **Call to Action**: Get Hunterdon County residents involved through mailers.

4. **Business Resource Materials**: Host meetings, Health Department and Municipality training and checklists. Programs to give recognition and incentives. Signs residents and businesses can download.

## Special Hunterdon County Programs

- **Electronic Waste Collection**: If you have any electronic items to be disposed, Hunterdon County hosts free Electronic Waste Recycling events throughout the year that you can use to your advantage. Accepted items include desktop printers, desktop fax machines, computers, computer monitors, televisions, DVD players, radios, cell phones, digital cameras, and keyboards. While most electronic items are accepted, there are some that are not accepted such as air conditioners, dehumidifiers, refrigerators, microwaves, propane tanks, and hazardous wastes. For event information, check out <a href='https://www.co.hunterdon.nj.us/recycling/electronics.html' target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Hunterdon County Waste Recycling Events</a>

- **Hazardous Waste Cleanup**: Throughout the year, the county holds a Household Hazardous Waste Clean Up event. All residents of Hunterdon County are welcome to attend this event, and no pre-registration is required. Because most household products may contain reactive and toxic ingredients, it is important to discard of them the proper way. Improper ways of disposing hazardous waste like pouring down the drain or the storm sewers or putting them out with the regular trash. Not only is this unlawful, but it is also horrible for the environment. We encourage residents of the county to participate in this event to prevent these hazardous materials from becoming a threat to the health of humans. More details on this event can be found at <a href='https://www.co.hunterdon.nj.us/recycling/cleanup' target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Hazardous Waste Clean-Up Day</a>.
