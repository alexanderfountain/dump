### Step 3: Dumpster Rental Permit Regulations for Hamilton NJ

This step is simple... there are none! You do not need a dumpster rental permit in Hamilton Township NJ if the dumpster is going in your driveway or on your property. Even if your dumpster needs to go in the street because it cannot fit in your driveway, you do not need a permit. Hamilton Township NJ prefers that you place the dumpster on your property, but if it does need to go into the street it is allowed if you follow these rules:

- The dumpster must be placed as close to the curb as possible.
- It cannot obstruct traffic flow on the street.
- Ensure that it is not located too close to a stop sign or on a corner that can cause an obstruction.
- A dumpster cannot block any driveway, including your own.
- The dumpster must have reflectors on it or cones around it at night.

When you order a dumpster that needs to go into the street from Alliance Disposal we ensure all these rules are followed to avoid any trouble for you.

### Step 4: Order Your Dumpster Rental

Now that you know what size and weight limit you need, and where the dumpster is going it is time to place your dumpster rental order. With Alliance Disposal you can place your order <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>online</Link>, over the phone at <TelDisplay />, or by <Link to={Paths.quoteRollOff}>email</Link>. Whichever method you are most comfortable with. All of our pricing is simple and transparent, there are never any hidden fees or surprises on your bill. Pricing is based on three main factors; location, type of debris and the weight of the debris. If you exceed the weight limit that came with your dumpster rental, you simply pay a prorated rate for the excess. Don't worry we make sure that you know how much weight comes with your dumpster and what the overage fee is before you order.

Once your dumpster rental is paid for and scheduled, the only thing you as the renter are responsible for is making sure that the delivery location does not have any obstacles that would prevent our roll-off truck from making the delivery. We typically need about 60 feet of space to deliver most containers. No one even has to be home for the delivery.

All of our dumpster rentals have a complimentary 14-day rental period. If for any reason you finish with it early, you can contact us at any time, and we will come pick it up for you. If you require a longer rental period, you can always extend it with flexible flat rate daily pricing.

### Step 5: Finishing Up With Your Dumpster

Your project is done, and your dumpster is sitting outside taking up space. What happens next? Once you give us permission, we come and pick up your dumpster and haul away your waste and debris. We transport it to the appropriate facility and make efforts to recycle as much as humanly possible.

The disposal facility will weigh the dumpster before and after it is dumped to get the weight of your debris. If the weight falls under your rental limit, you’re all set! If not, the agreed upon overage fee will be added to your final bill. At the very end of the process we send you your payment receipt, and if applicable a copy of your dump ticket, via email.

## Hamilton NJ: Going Green

As a company that focuses on the benefits or recycling and the importance of sustainability, we always try to recognize towns and cities across the nation that are doing their part to be sustainable and mindful. Hamilton Township was the first in the state to require the use of cleaner natural gas solid waste vehicles as an alternative to diesel-powered vehicles as a means to reduce air pollution. The Hamilton Township Municipal Government continues to be committed to implementing numerous energy conservation efforts. This includes updating numerous buildings and facilities to LED lighting, installing solar panels across the city, modernizing AC systems, planting shade trees, leading rain barrel workshops, and much more!

From our team at Alliance Disposal to the government officials and residents of Hamilton Township, we thank you for your continued efforts toward a greener future for us all. Residents and local businesses can learn more about financial incentives, programs and services that help save energy, money and the environment by visiting the State of New Jersey’s Clean Energy Program’s website <a href='https://www.njcleanenergy.com/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NJCleanEnergy.com</a>. Businesses can also register for free with <a href='http://registry.njsbdc.com/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New Jersey Sustainable Business Registry</a> in order to show commitment to reducing your environmental footprint.

## Recycling in Hamilton Township NJ

As a company that focuses on sustainability and carbon neutrality, recycling plays a large role in what we do and promote. As a Hamilton New Jersey resident, there are many ways that you can contribute to recycling efforts. The first step is remembering some key recycling reminders.

Recycling Reminders

These are some helpful recycling reminders put together by Hamilton Township:

- When in doubt, throw it out in a regular trash can. Items that are not accepted can ruin entire recycling batches.
- Check the number on your plastics! Hamilton only collects plastics labeled with #1 and #2.
- Broken glass should be placed in the trash, not the recycling.
- Plastic bags cannot be recycled.
- Pizza boxes are not recyclable due to the grease and oil residue

Hamilton Township Recycling Service

Hamilton Township offers trash pickup twice per week and recycling pickup once per week. The day that your trash and recycling is picked up is determined by the street you live on. In order to see what your specific pickup schedule is, visit the <a href='http://www.hamiltonnj.com/content/228309/252258/default.aspx' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hamilton Township website</a>. A maximum of three bulk items may be left curbside for pickup and will be picked up on the second pickup day each week. Debris from larger construction projects or home/garage/basement cleanouts will NOT be picked up on these collection days and requires hiring a private hauler like Alliance Disposal.

Bulk Items

Hamilton has a complex system involving bulk item pickup. Each bulk item has different requirements and pickup schedules can vary. To see a comprehensive guide, visit the <a href='http://www.hamiltonnj.com/getridofit' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Do I Get Rid of It Guide</a> put together by Hamilton Township. Certain items are allowed to be picked up curbside whereas others are not. Some items, like leaves, are scheduled to be picked up only once per year. Due to all of these regulations, Hamilton residents should become familiar with the guide linked above. Or… there’s always another route for bulk items...

Avoid the Stress, Work With Alliance Disposal

What if you have more than three bulk items? What if you don’t want to memorize what can and can’t be placed outside, or worry about getting all of your leaves placed curbside on the one right day? That is where Alliance can help you out. We offer on-demand bulk trash and recycling pickup for these items that the city makes so confusing to handle. With us, you don’t have to worry about anything! It is as simple as scheduling a bulk trash pickup through our <Link to={Paths.quoteOnDemand}>online on-demand pickup</Link>, tell us about what you have, and let us haul it away for you on your schedule.

## Hamilton Township’s Ecological Facility

Looking to drop off something that can’t be picked up curbside? Hamilton’s Ecological Facility accepts a multitude of restricted items. They are located at 1360 Kuser Rd and are open 8am-3pm Monday-Saturday.

Items you are allowed to drop off include televisions, leaves, untreated/unpainted wood, tires, auto batteries, motor oil, cell phones, DVD players, newspapers, cardboard, grass clippings, metal items, bricks, concrete, and cinder blocks. If you are looking to dispose of any of these items, the Ecological Facility is the easiest way to do this properly.
