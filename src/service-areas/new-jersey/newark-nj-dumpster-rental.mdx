## Dumpster Rental Process in Newark NJ

### Step 1: Determine Purpose

The first step in renting a dumpster in Newark, or in any city, is figuring out what you need it for or the project you are going to undertake. Dumpsters are useful for a variety of reasons, but hte main use revolves around eliminating the need to collect and haul bulk waste yourself. Some typical uses for roll-off dumpster rentals include the following:

- Home Cleanout
- Landscaping Projects
- Kitchen, Bath and Basement Remodeling
- Roof Replacement Jobs
- Concrete, Brick and Metal Disposal
- Storm Debris Cleanup
- General Construction
- Large Demolition Projects

### Step 2: Estimate Your Waste Disposal Needs

### Step 3: Dumpster Permit Regulations

Now that you have determined you need a dumpster and have chosen the perfect size and weight limit, you can move on to obtaining a permit... or maybe not! Dumpster rental permits in Newark NJ are dependent upon where you will be placing your dumpster. If you are planning on having your dumpster placed on your driveway or anywhere else on your personal property, you won't need a permit to rent a dumpster. If you don't have the space for a dumpster on your property and will instead be planning to  have your dumpster placed on a county road, you will need to obtain a permit. To learn more about the dumpster rental permitting process in Newark, or verify that you need one, visit our <Link to={Paths.dumpsterPermits}>dumpster rental permits</Link> page.

### Step 4: Order Your Dumpster Rental

Now that you have your plans ironed out, you can place your order for your dumpster rental either <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>online</Link>, over the phone at <TelDisplay />, or by <Link to={Paths.quoteRollOff}>email</Link>. We make ordering easy! Pricing is based on three factors; location, type of debris, and debris weight. The weight you believe your debris to be is closely tied to the size of the dumpster you chose above. When you order a dumpster, you pre-purchase a discounted amount of weight. If you go over the weight limit you simply pay the prorated rate for the excess. If you do go overweight we always provide a copy of your dump ticket from the certified scale so you can see the exact weight of your debris. We make sure you know exactly what you're paying for when you rent from us. You will never see a hidden or mysterious fee on your bill with Alliance Disposal.

Once you purchase and schedule your dumpster rental, all you have to do is make sure that the delivery location is clear of obstacles so that the roll off truck can reach the spot where you would like the dumpster to be placed. All Alliance Disposal dumpsters come with a complimentary 14-day rental period. If you don't need your dumpster for all 14 days you can call us any time before and we'll pick the dumpster up for you. If you need your dumpster for longer than 14 days you can extend your rental with flexible flat rate daily pricing.

### Step 5: We Haul Your Debris Away

Once your project is finished, we will come pick up your dumpster and haul away your waste. Once picked up, it will be brought to the appropriated disposal facility in an effort to recycle as much material as possible.

At the disposal facility the material you put into the dumpster will get weighed. If you are within the weight limit than you're done! If you go over the weight limit the appropriate and agreed upon overage fee will be applied at a prorated rate. You will receive your payment receipt, and if applicable a copy of your dump ticket, via email.

## Newark New Jersey Recycling Guide

As a company that focuses on sustainability and carbon neutrality, recycling plays a large role in what we do and promote. As a Newark New Jersey resident, there are many ways that you can contribute to recycling efforts. The first step is understanding what can be recycled and how these recyclables are classified in Newark.

Permitted Recyclables

Newark allows their residents to recycle cardboard, paper, beverage cartons, cans, plastic bottles, jugs, glass bottles, and jars. These recyclables are typically classified into two different categories, "Paper and Boxes", and "Containers". Paper and Boxes includes the cardboard, paper, and beverage cartons. Whereas the Containers category is comprised of the cans, plastic, and glass.

City Recycling Service

This categorization of recyclables, which may seem redundant, actually plays a role in the manner in which Newark manages its recycling efforts. These two categories of recyclables are not picked up on the same day with the city-run service. Rather, the recyclables are expected to be separated and divided for pickup on two different days. The day in which each type of recyclables are picked up depends on where in Newark you live. To determine your specific pickup schedule through the city service, visit the <a href='https://www.newarknj.gov/departments/recycling' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newark NJ in-depth recycling guide</a>.

Bulk Items

According to the city of Newark, bulk items include couches, tables, chairs, mattresses, dressers, closets, rugs, exercise equipment and vanities, and are only picked up once a month. Depending on where you live in Newark, the bulk collection day either falls on the first or second Wednesday of the month. To verify which zone you live in and what day your bulk collection is scheduled for, visit the Newark trash and recycling page. Every residential privately owned property is limited to ten bulk items that can be placed outside on the scheduled bulk collection day.

Avoid the Complexity, Work with Alliance Disposal

What if you have more than ten bulk items? What if you don’t want to have your old couch and
mattress sitting on your lawn? That is where Alliance can help you out. We offer on-demand bulk trash and recycling pickup for these larger items that the city services struggle to haul. The city actually requires residents that have more than ten bulk items to hire private haulers like us. It is simple to setup and you can <Link to={Paths.quoteOnDemand}>schedule on-demand pickup online</Link>.
