## Preparing For Your Dumpster Rental

When you decide on which type of dumpster and size fits your needs best, <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>order online</Link> to rent your dumpster. Next, make sure you are prepared for your dumpster rental before it arrives. You do not want to leave everything until the last minute, because you only have a limited time with the dumpster. Before the dumpster arrives, you should have a plan on what you want to achieve and put in the dumpster. Make sure you are familiar with the <Link to={Paths.guideWhatCanGoIntoDumpster}>items that can and can’t go in dumpsters</Link>.

Hazardous items can be very dangerous, items that cannot go into the dumpsters include:
- Wet Paint
- Oils
- Tires
- Asbestos
- Pesticides
- Motor oil
- Household Cleaners
- Batteries

Another thing you need to be aware of is weight limits. Our dumpsters do come with a weight limit, but you will always be made aware of what it is and how much the weight overage fee would be. We also offer concrete dumpsters that are made for dumpsters made for heavier items. Therefore, if you are looking to put concrete, asphalt, block or stone into a dumpster, you should be sure to check out the concrete dumpster to help save you a lot of money. We also recommend making a schedule for each day of the rental period. People find this very helpful sometimes the pick up date arrives and people are not done with their project. Not to worry though you can always extend your dumpster rental for a daily flat rate. We want everything to go as smoothly as possible for our customers.

## Roofing dumpster rentals

If you are looking to get rid of an old roof or install a new one, a <Link to={Paths.roofingDumpsters}>roofing dumpster rental</Link> would be the most appropriate. These dumpsters can dispose of material from asphalt shingles, slate or tile and wooden shingles, roofing felt, and nails. Our roofing dumpsters make it easier because you are allowed to throw these materials right into the dumpster. The sizes we offer for our roofing dumpsters range from 10 yards to 40 yards. The 10-yard dumpster is made for small re-roofing projects. While, the 40-yard dumpster is a great option for bigger buildings that are replacing or installing a roof.

## Concrete dumpster rentals

Concrete materials are able to be put in construction dumpsters, although if you have a lot they will easily make you go over the weight limit. If you were to go over the weight limit, it is not a big deal, but will also need to pay more as a result. We will always be upfront with you and let you know the weight overage price before you rent your dumpster. Since concrete is very heavy, we have a <Link to={Paths.concreteDumpsters}>concrete dumpster</Link> that is made for heavy weight concrete materials such as asphalt, block, and stone. Alliance Disposal will be sure to recycle these materials at specialty facilities near your home. Concrete dumpsters are ideal for if your projects contain driveway and slab removals, tearing down walls, and home or business remodeling.

## Ready For Your Dumpster To Be Picked Up

Once your roll off dumpster is filled, contact us and we’ll come pick it up and bring it to a nearby facility. We make it our mission to have as much of your waste is recycled as possible. If your dumpster needs to be emptied during your rental period that can also be done and we will go dispose of the items, then bring your dumpster back to you to be filled more. At the facility your roll off dumpster’s debris will be weighed and then compared to the weight that was purchased originally. If the weight falls within your rental limit, you are all set! Although, If the weight goes over it is no problem, there will just be an overage fee will be added to your final bill. We will always tell you in advance what the overage fees will be before you rent your dumpster and the weight of your purchase.
