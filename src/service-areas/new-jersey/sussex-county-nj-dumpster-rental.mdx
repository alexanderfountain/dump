## FAQs for Sussex County Dumpster Rental Services

### What can and cannot be thrown away in a dumpster in Sussex County NJ?

As a general rule of thumb, any non-hazardous waste can be thrown away in a dumpster. This means most household waste, bulky furniture, construction debris, yard waste, and appliances are fair game. However, certain materials are considered hazardous and cannot be thrown away in a dumpster in Sussex County, or anywhere else in the US. These items include asbestos, wet paint, electronics, tires, batteries, fuel, oil, propane tanks, and hot water tanks. You can learn more about hazardous waste regulations on our <Link to={Paths.guideWhatCanGoIntoDumpster}>What Can You Throw in a Dumpster</Link> guide which answers the more specific questions we have received on this topic. If you have any future questions about hazardous waste, feel free to <Link to={Paths.contact}>contact us</Link>, and we will be happy to help you!

### How do I dispose of hazardous waste in Sussex County NJ?

The Sussex County Municipal Utilities Authority (SCMUA) hosts two Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) days each year for residents to dispose of hazardous waste. Unfortunately, the SCMUA cannot accept Hazardous Waste without an authorized HHW event. Residents may bring up to 100 pounds of dry household hazardous waste and/or 10 gallons of liquid waste at each event. To learn more about the exact dates of HHW days, drop off location, and examples of what Sussex County considers hazardous waste, visit the <a href="https://www.scmua.org/cit-e-access/webpage.cfm?tid=121&tpid=11926" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">SCMUA</a> website.

### How do I prepare for my dumpster rental?

Before ordering a dumpster, you will have to decide on a size, weight limit, and rental period. Alliance Disposal provides a wide range of sizes and a default 14 day rental period. If you’ve never rented a dumpster or roll-off container before, there’s no need to worry! Our <Link to={Paths.howToRentADumpster}>How to Rent a Dumpster</Link> guide provides a detailed walkthrough of the steps you should follow. After you’ve successfully ordered your dumpster, you will need to make sure the delivery location is clear of any debris or obstacles. This will make it easy for the roll-off truck to place your dumpster exactly where you’d like it. When you’re finished with the dumpster, simply give us a call and we’ll come pick it up!

### Does Sussex County require dumpster rental permits?

Permits are issued at the town level, so permit requirements will vary based on the city you live in. Generally, permits are not required if you are placing your dumpster on private property such as your driveway. However, if you are planning on placing your permit on public property, like a county road, you may need to get a permit. Of course, we always recommend calling your city clerk to double-check the permit requirements for your specific situation. Dumpster permit applications can usually be found on your city’s website. More information on the permit requirements of your city can be found on our <Link to={Paths.dumpsterPermits}>dumpster rental permits</Link> page.
