## Guide to Renting a Dumpster In Atlantic County

Renting a dumpster doesn’t have to be a hassle. In order to make the dumpster rental process as simple and straightforward as possible, Alliance Disposal has put together a helpful guide on <Link to={Paths.howToRentADumpster}>How to Rent a Dumpster</Link> that will take you through each step of the process from ordering to pickup. At Alliance Disposal, we pride ourselves on going above and beyond when it comes to meeting your waste disposal needs and exceeding your customer service expectations. 

### Atlantic County Dumpster Rental Permits

Before ordering your dumpster rental in Atlantic County, you should check with your local municipality to determine if your town or city requires a dumpster rental permit. Please contact your local Clerk’s Office for more details on dumpster rental rules and regulations in your area. Further information can be found through your <a href="https://atlanticcountyclerk.org/helpful-links/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">municipality website</a>. If you have any questions on whether or not you will need a dumpster rental permit, we would be happy to help you over the phone or through our easy to use <Link to={Paths.dumpsterPermits}>Dumpster Rental Permit Lookup Tool</Link>.

### Dumpster Rental Weight Limits

Each dumpster size comes with a pre purchased weight limit. This is the amount of weight you can put in the dumpster at a discounted disposal rate. Of course, it is no big deal if you happen to exceed this weight limit. You will simply pay the standard and prorated "overage" fee on the extra weight. This rate will be clear to you before you order your dumpster rental, and we will provide you with a copy of the certified scale reading and dump ticket to ensure total transparency. At Alliance Disposal, we believe in honest service and upfront pricing. For more information, view our <Link to={Paths.rollOffSizingGuide}>Dumpster Rental Pricing and Sizing Guide</Link>. We are dedicated to going beyond your customer service expectations and will ensure that your waste container needs are met, so feel free to call us at <TelDisplay /> with any further questions or inquiries about alternate weight limit options. 

Something to keep in mind is that trash containers tend to fill up quickly, and it can be difficult to judge how many cubic yards in container space is necessary for your project cleanup. In order to ensure the most cost-effective and efficient dumpster rental experience, it is important to consider the amount and type of waste material that you expect to throw in your dumpster rental. Construction and remodeling projects tend to result in heavier waste materials. While these materials can be thrown in dumpster rentals along with other trash items in small amounts, it may be best to order a dedicated dumpster for waste materials like <Link to={Paths.roofingDumpsters}>roofing shingles</Link> or <Link to={Paths.concreteDumpsters}>concrete</Link>, rock, and dirt waste to avoid going over the pre purchased dumpster weight limits. Please note that construction and demolition debris should not be mixed with other waste items if you are planning to discharge these materials at the Atlantic County Utilities Authority (ACUA) landfill site or transfer station. To learn more about how to properly dispose of waste items in Atlantic County, refer to the <a href="http://www.acua.com/wastewizard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">ACUA Waste Wizard</a>. 

Once your dumpster is full, or you no longer need your dumpster rental, Alliance Disposal will pick up the waste container if you send us an <Link to={Paths.contact}>email</Link> or give us a call. If you need the dumpster rental for more than the complimentary 14 day rental period, that’s no problem – just give us a call and we can extend your rental with an agreed-upon daily flat rate. When you are ready to order a dumpster, you can place your <Link to={Paths.orderRollOff}>order online</Link>, by phone, or via <Link to={Paths.quoteRollOff}>email</Link>.

## Atlantic County Solid Waste Rules and Regulations 

Before taking any waste materials to the Atlantic County Utilities Authority, please complete the following steps:
1. Learn how to properly dispose of your item using the <a href="http://www.acua.com/wastewizard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">ACUA Waste Wizard</a>.
2. Fill out the <a href="http://www.acua.com/uploadedFiles/Site/Disposal_And_Recycling/Location_and_Landfill/OriginDisposalForm.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Waste Origin and Disposal Form</a> prior to visiting the landfill.
3. Review the <a href="http://www.acua.com/content.aspx?id=396" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Payment and Account Billing Options</a>.
4. Become familiar with the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=15afDpYA7lRjq_a8Z2sBxTduaWOw&ll=39.41923834908194%2C-74.53788444399834&z=16" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Environmental Park Facility Map</a>.

It is also important to consider that the Atlantic County Utilities Authority (ACUA) has specific rules and regulations when it comes to discharging certain waste items at the county landfill. In particular, 
The ACUA requires construction and demolition debris remain separate from other waste materials when discharged at the ACUA’s transfer station or landfill. Construction and demolition debris include:
- Insulation 
- Roofing Materials
- Plaster and Wallboard
- Windows
- Treated and Untreated Wood Scraps
- Concrete, Asphalt, Bricks, Blocks
- Linoleum and Tile
- Kitchen and Bath Fixtures (tubs, toilets, sinks)
If over 30% of the total load is of a different waste category, customers will be charged the higher of the two associated tipping fees. Construction and demolition (C&D) debris larger than 10 feet in any dimension will not be accepted without prior approval and will be subject to an oversize fee. For more details on proper C&D debris disposal, visit the <a href="http://acua.com/content.aspx?id=332" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Atlantic County Utilities Authority website</a>.

<a href="http://acua.com/content.aspx?id=364" target="_blank" rel ="noopener norefferer">Bulky waste</a>, including items such as furniture, mattresses, and other nontraditional items that aren’t a result of construction or demolition activities should not be mixed in with other waste materials when discharged at the ACUA facility. Waste loads containing corrugated cardboard and other mandatory recyclables will be surcharged. For more information on Atlantic County rules and regulations relating to the use of solid waste and recycling facilities, please refer to the <a href="http://www.acua.com/uploadedFiles/Site/Disposal_And_Recycling/Location_and_Landfill/RULESandREGULATIONS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">ACUA Solid Waste Rules and Regulations</a> handbook.

### What You Can - and Can’t - Throw in a Dumpster

The Atlantic County ACUA Haneman "Fritz" Environmental Park waste facility accepts standard materials that you can throw in a dumpster, however, for certain types of waste materials, you will be charged <a href="http://acua.com/disposal-recycling/rates-procedures-operation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">different disposal rates</a>. Hazardous waste materials cannot be thrown in a dumpster and will not be accepted at the ACUA landfill mixed in with other forms of trash. Common hazardous waste materials include but are not limited to:
- Cleaning Products like glass cleaner, all purpose cleaner, bathroom cleaner, and so on
- Auto care products
- Pesticides, insecticides, and weed Killers
- Stains and varnishes
- Pool chemicals
- Spray Paint
- Items containing mercury such as fluorescent bulbs and old thermometers

Please refer to the ACUA website for more information on hazardous waste materials and for specifics on the Atlantic County <a href="http://acua.com/hhw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Household Hazardous Waste Drop-off</a> program. 

In general, most non-hazardous waste is acceptable to throw in a dumpster, but for a more in-depth guide, refer to our guide <Link to={Paths.guideWhatCanGoIntoDumpster}>What Can You Throw in a Dumpster</Link>. Typical household or commercial waste items like unwanted junk, yard debris, renovation materials, and old furniture and appliances can be thrown in a dumpster. Used appliances that are still working can avoid the landfill and be reused through apps like <a  href="https://www.letgo.com/" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener norefferer">letgo</a>. At Alliance Disposal, we encourage you to recycle whenever possible in accordance with the <a href="https://www.nj.gov/dep/dshw/" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener norefferer">New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection</a>. 

## Recycling in Atlantic County

Atlantic County is committed to enhancing the quality of life through the protection of lands and waters from pollution, and provides responsible waste management services to assist residents and local businesses in the pursuit of environmental health. The Atlantic County Utilities Authority uses new technologies, innovations and employee ideas to provide the highest quality and cost effective environmental services. For more information on Atlantic County waste management procedures, you can look into the <a href="https://www.atlantic-county.org/environmental-health/topics.asp?topicID=236" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Solid Waste Control Program</a>. 

Alliance Disposal encourages all Atlantic County residents to follow the <a href="http://www.acua.com/disposal-recycling/residential/recycling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">ACUA Recycling Guidelines</a> in order to do their part in furthering local sustainability efforts. Residents of Atlantic County may drop off single-stream recycling materials, shredded paper, and bulky rigid plastics at the designated recycling drop-offs in the ACUA Environmental Park during regular solid waste operation hours. Large businesses, schools, and municipalities should call ahead to make drop-off arrangements. Municipalities that do not have a recycling contract with the ACUA must proceed to the scale house and will be charged a $35 tipping fee per ton of waste. For more information on recycling drop offs, please refer to the <a href="http://acua.com/recycling-drop-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">ACUA Recycling Drop Offs</a> guide. 

If you have a smaller amount of recyclable or other waste materials such as <a href="http://www.acua.com/disposal-recycling/yard-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">yard waste</a>, please refer to the ACUA Trash and Recycling Container Guidelines for more information on curbside pickups in your municipality. Collection schedules will be different depending on your home residence, so view the <a href="http://www.acua.com/towns.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Municipal Collection Information</a> page to learn more about residential curbside collections. 

Businesses and schools are also encouraged to recycle. Not only is <a href="https://www.nj.gov/dep/dshw/recycling/wastewise/njwwcasestudy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">recycling economical</a>, but it is beneficial to recycle for various other reasons including:
- Business recycling is free in many Atlantic County towns and cities.
- Recycling keeps waste from trash bins, saving money and the environment.
- Atlantic County offers <a href="http://www.acua.com/content.aspx?id=252">single stream recycling</a>, so you do not have to separate recyclable materials including plastics, metals, glass, cartons, cardboard, and paper.
- It is also the law in New Jersey!

Atlantic County has many online resources for <a href="http://acua.com/disposal-recycling/business-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">Business Recycling</a> and <a href="http://www.acua.com/disposal-recycling/school-recycling/" target="_blank" rel = "noopener norefferer">School Recycling</a> including case studies and guides such as the <a href="http://www.acua.com/uploadedFiles/Site/Disposal_And_Recycling/Business/Commercial%20Brochure%202019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">ACUA Commercial Recycling Guide</a> and the <a href="https://www.nj.gov/dep/seeds/recycle.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">NJDEP School Recycling Manual</a>.
