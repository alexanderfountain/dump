## When you rent a dumpster you make a difference

Our mission is to achieve carbon neutrality in the waste management industry through innovation, improved efficiency and planting trees. That is why when you rent a dumpster from Alliance Disposal we have a tree planted in a forest undergoing reforestation efforts.

Unlike other companies, when you make a purchase from Alliance Disposal you are making a positive impact in the world. One tree can absorb 48 lbs of carbon dioxide per year. One tree also absorbs 1,000 gallons of rainfall every year that would otherwise need to be pumped and filtered through storm drains, which would produce even more carbon dioxide.
